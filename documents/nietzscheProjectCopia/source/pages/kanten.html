                <h2>ETHIC OF KANT</h2>
            </header>
            <p class="textcnt">Immanuel Kant, an 18th century philosopher, developed a deontological ethics based on rational and universal principles. Here is a summary of Kant's ethics:

                Deontology: Kant's ethics is deontological, meaning it focuses on duty and moral rules rather than the consequences of actions. For Kant, the morality of actions is determined by their conformity with rational and universal principles.
                
                Categorical Imperative: This is the central principle of Kantian ethics. The categorical imperative is a universal rule that must be followed regardless of desires or consequences. There are several formulations of the categorical imperative, two of the best known are:
                
                Formulation of Universality: "Act only according to a maxim such that you can at the same time will it to become a universal law."
                Formulation of Humanity: "Act in such a way that you use humanity, both in your own person and in the person of anyone else, always at the same time as an end, and never simply as a means."
                Autonomy and Rationality: Kant believes that rational beings have the ability to determine moral laws through reason. Moral autonomy implies acting in accordance with laws that reason itself establishes, rather than being governed by inclinations or desires.
                
                Good Will: For Kant, the only thing that is good without qualifications is good will. This means acting out of duty, in accordance with the moral law, and not out of personal inclinations or desired consequences.
                
                Respect for Human Dignity: Kantian ethics emphasizes respect for the dignity and intrinsic value of each individual. Treating others as ends in themselves means recognizing and respecting their autonomy and moral value.
                
                Morality and Freedom: Kant sees morality as intrinsically linked to freedom. True freedom is the ability to act in accordance with reason and moral principles, and not be enslaved by impulses or desires.
                
                In short, Immanuel Kant's ethics are based on acting in accordance with rational and universal principles (categorical imperative), respecting the dignity and autonomy of each individual, and focusing on duty and moral intention, rather than the consequences of actions.</p>
